            <p class="bball-description"> The 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team, nicknamed the "Dream Team", was the first American Olympic team to feature active professional players from the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team has been described by journalists around the world as the greatest sports team ever assembled.[2][3][4]

                At the 1992 Summer Olympics held in Barcelona, the team defeated its opponents by an average of 44 points en route to the gold medal against Croatia.[5][6]
                
                The team was collectively inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010, and the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017. The Naismith Hall calls the team "the greatest collection of basketball talent on the planet".[7] In addition to the team induction, 11 players and three coaches have also been inducted individually into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame. </p>
